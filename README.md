### ABOUT ME

Software testing is something I want to do today until retirement :wink: 

Why testing? I have always been comfortable with the computer, and have used it in a wide range of ways - from the usual Office, through graphics or CAD type programs to games, especially my favorite RPG. And I guess it's my way of going through these games that perfectly shows that testing is something just for me - I never limit myself to the main story line, I try to complete all side missions and explore the game world.

Previous work experience has developed in me qualities useful in this profession. 
I focus on development, I independently deepen the knowledge outlined during my studies: I use subject literature, thematic webinars, blogs, etc., especially valuing Cherry-IT initiatives and meetings of the Tri-City testing community 3QA.

__I am currently a mentee in the eighth edition of the Tech Leaders mentoring program.__
